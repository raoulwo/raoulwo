### Raoul Wograndl

Currently pursuing my Master's degree in *Software Engineering* which I will hopefully achieve by 2027. When I'm not studying I like to spend time tinkering on my personal projects.
My tech-stack of choice for full-stack development is *Laravel* and *Vue.js*, though I'm eager to learn more about *Livewire* as well.
